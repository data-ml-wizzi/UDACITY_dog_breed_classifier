# Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
As part of the "Data Science" Nanodegree on Udacity we shall show our skills with creating an Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Pipeline to classify dog breed and identify humand-dog resemblance. For the user a front end shall be supplied to upload the picture and then retrieve the breed of the dog (or the resemblance of the human). If neither a human or a dog is uploaded this shall be recognized and stated.

To achieve this I was guided towards the topic by working trough a Jupyter Notebook. There I did
1. loading the data and some basic data exploration and visualizations as well as data preparations (resizing and normalising) for the CNN models
2. build a human face detector
3. build a dog detector based on a pretrained ResNet50 Network
4. build an own CNN
5. build an CNN with transfer learnin using the VGG16 CNN
6. build an own

# Data <a name="data"></a>
The Data was provided bith Appen (former Figure8). Their datasets include roughly 26k messages of disasters all around the world as well as their categorization. </br>

The following two CSV files are provided:</br>

<ul>
  <li>messages.csv: ~ 26k messages
  <li>categories.csv: 36 disaster categories 
</ul>

# Instructions <a name="instructions"></a>

1. Clone or download the repo

2. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/dogImages`. 

3. Download the [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`.  If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder. 

4. Donwload the [Xception bottleneck features](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogXceptionData.npz) for the dog dataset.  Place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features`.

5. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your model.

    - To run ML pipeline that trains the classifier and saves its best version </br>
        
        `python models/train_dog_classifier.py`

6. Change to the app directory: `cd app`

7. Run your web app: `python run.py`

7. Click the `PREVIEW` button in the Terminal to open the homepage via http://loclhost:3000 or http://127.0.0.1:3000

8. Upload a picture and let the breed be classified. E voila.


# Results <a name="results"></a>
In the web app (Figure 1) the user can enter messages at the top, which are then classified based on the stored model. Below, various statistical evaluations of the training data are also shown:

- Distribution of all messages according to genres ('news', 'direct', 'social') that where used for the training of the model
- Distribution of all messages according to the 36 categories that where used for the training of the model
- Distribution of the top five categories for all messages that where used for the training of the model
